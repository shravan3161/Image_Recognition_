This repository contains a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based image classification model for High-accuracy image classification on Fashion MNIST & CIFAR-10 using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Data Augmentation, and Batch Normalization.
The model is built and trained in Python using TensorFlow/Keras and includes data preprocessing, augmentation, training, evaluation, and visualization through a 5-day bootcamp conducted by Devtown.
The above .ipynb file contains both Fashion NMIST and CIFAR-10 dataset trained 
Over five days, I explored the fundamentals of image recognition, convolutional neural networks (CNNs), data preprocessing, augmentation, evaluation metrics, and model deployment. I worked on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and Cats vs. Dogs datasets, achieving high accuracy in digit, object, and binary image classification tasks.
